# Autofill-bootstrapped

This is bootstrapped code you can use to implement autofill feature. This codebase has been already configured with React(if you want to use it) and bundled with webpack.

## Task
1. The extension needs to work only on two merchants -
  - https://www.flipkart.com/
  - https://www.amazon.in/

2. When the user is on a screen, clicking the button in the popup view will show the same notification it shows right now.
3. When the user reaches the checkout screen, and the option to enter the Credit/Debit Card details is present, it should autofill card details that are hardcoded in the project(see /src/data.js) in the respective input fields. Once that's done, it should show a notification that card details are autofilled.

## Requirements
1. Code quality is the foremost priority.
2. Build a common webextension codebase for firefox and chrome browsers.
3. Functional approach should be used for writing code.
4. UI is not a priority, so no code needs to written for the UI.
